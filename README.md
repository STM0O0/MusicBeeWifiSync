MusicBee Wifi Sync app

Made compatible with Android 13 (=tested), maybe higher(?)
I have not made any other changes then those suggested by BoringName to make it compatible with Android 11. I might do so in the future, if I have time and/or reason to do so...

If anyone has code improvement suggestions, you can send them in through the issues or via a custom fork.
!!! No feature suggestions please !!!
